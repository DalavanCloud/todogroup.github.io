# Talk Openly

# Develop Openly

## For companies committed to open source.

Does your company release open source projects? Would you like to improve how
you interact with the open source community to better manage and run your
projects?

TODO is an open [group of companies](../members) who want to collaborate on
practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective open source
projects and programs. [Read more](../about) about the group, or [contact
us](../join) to get involved.
