# Talk openly, develop openly

Open source is part of the fabric of each of our companies. Between us, our open source programs
enable us to use, contribute to, and maintain, thousands of projects - both large and small.

These programs face many challenges, including ensuring high-quality and frequent releases, engaging
with developer communities, and using and contributing back to other projects effectively.

The members of this group are committed to working together in order to overcome these challenges.
We will be sharing experiences, developing best practices, and working on common tooling. But we
can’t do this alone. If you are a company using or sharing open source, we welcome you to join us
and help make this happen.

**TODO: talk openly, develop openly.** We believe we can better improve our open source programs -
and our contributions to the open source movement as a whole - by working together.
