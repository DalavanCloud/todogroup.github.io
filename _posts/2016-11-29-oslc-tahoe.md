The TODO Group will be hosting a formal open source office track at the Open Source Leadership Summit in Tahoe next year:

We hosted a track last year and encourage the wider community to <a href="http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/open-source-leadership-summit/program/cfp">submit your proposals</a>. We are in particular looking for proposals in how companies have established open source programs (including their structure) and lessons learned in the process. We also love to hear about case studies in the process of open sourcing projects, from the good, the bad and the ugly :)

Good luck, we look forward to seeing you in Tahoe!
