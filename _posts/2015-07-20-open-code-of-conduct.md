title: Announcing the Open Code of Conduct

We believe open source communities should be a welcoming place for all participants. Through our experiences within the TODO Group, we strongly believe that a code of conduct helps set the ground rules for participation in communities and helps build a culture of respect. By adopting and honoring a code of conduct, communities can communicate their values, set expectations and outline a process for dealing with unwelcome behavior when it arises.

We are proud to share the [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct), an easy-to-reuse code of conduct template for open source communities. Some members of the TODO Group have already [adopted this code of conduct](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct#what-companies-or-commnities-support-or-use-the-open-code-of-conduct) for the projects they maintain and more plan to do so in the near future.

We hope sharing this with you will enable you to easily establish a code of conduct for your respective open source communities. If your project doesn't already have a code of conduct, then we encourage you to check out the [Open Code of Conduct](http://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct/) as a starting point and adapt it to your community.

See the [FAQ](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct#faq) for more details.
