Open source software is used by everyone, and we believe open source communities should be a welcoming place for anyone that wants to participate. Through our experiences at the TODO Group, we strongly believe that a code of conduct helps set the ground rules for participation in communities and helps build a culture of respect. By adopting and upholding a code of conduct, communities can communicate their values, set expecations, and outline a process for dealing with unwelcome behavior when it arises.

We are proud to share the [Open Code of Conduct](https://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct), an easy-to-reuse code of conduct for open source communities. We hope sharing this with you will enable you to easily establish a code of conduct for your respective open source community.

If your project doesn't already have a code of conduct, then we encourage you to check out the [Open Code of Conduct](https://todogroup.org/opencodeofconduct) and consider if your community can commit to upholding it. See the [FAQ](https://github.com/todogroup/opencodeofconduct#faq) for more details.
