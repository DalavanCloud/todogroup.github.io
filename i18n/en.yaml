    Does your company release open source projects? Would you like to improve how you interact with the open source community to better manage and run your projects?

    TODO is an open [group of companies](../members) who want to collaborate on practices, tools, and other ways to run successful and effective open source projects and programs. [Read more](../about) about the group, or [contact us](../join) to get involved.
